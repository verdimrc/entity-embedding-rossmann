Regression: target variables need not be strictly gaussian distribution. In this
case, making it so (which in our case via box-cox) lower the performance.
Instead, the original (and simpler) log normalization works better.

Original vs holiday features: result not conclusive with just 1-fold. Need
k-fold CV to gain more credible results.
